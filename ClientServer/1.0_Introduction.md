# 1.0 Introduction to SAD

## Introduction
The purpose of this course is to show you how to create a fully functional, dynamic, web application using C#. This will be accomplished using Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server. To get the most out of this course you should have a solid foundation in object oriented programming, the C# language, and database skills.

## Software
For this course you will need the following software (free to download and use) installed on your computer:

* Visual Studio Community Edition
* SQL Express
* LINQPad

### Visual Studio Community Edition (VSCE)
This software is fully functional and works similar to Visual Studio Porfessional. You will need to sign up with a Microsoft account to use VSCE beyond 30 days.

### SQL Express
This software is fully functional and works similar to the full version of SQL Server. There are limitations with the Express version but in this course you will not need to worry about them.

### LINQPad
This software is fully functional. You can pay for the full version to get full intellisense when writing LINQ queries.

## Optional Software
One of the tools software developers use routinely is a code repository called GitHub. Although you are free to use any code backup strategy you are comfortable using, I strongly encourage you to sign up for a GitHub account and install GitHub Desktop on your computer.
