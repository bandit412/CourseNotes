# Course Notes

## Introduction
These notes are intended as augmented content for classes that I teach/have taught at NAIT in the Digital Media and IT (DMIT) Program, or in Harbin, China. They are not created to replace in-class instruction or notes available through [Moodle](https://moodle.nait.ca/my/). There is no specific order, or timeline, to how each set of course notes gets updated as this is a personal project. The courses are not listed as DMIT course numbers, but as specific topics/areas of related content. Some of the material is from older courses which may be useful, and some is from future concept ideas.

## Courses
The following courses will be included in these course notes:

* Math and Physics
* Web Development
* Networking
* Client-Server Programming
* Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)
